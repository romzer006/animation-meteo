## Frame 9 — Type 4 : la supercellule

- scene: Fond orange, « TYPE 4 / 4 — le roi ». Une supercellule massive dont la colonne tourne en spirale, un grêlon géant « pamplemousse », rafales, une tornade descend.
- voiceover: "Et le roi : la supercellule. Son courant ascendant tourne sur lui-même. Grêlons gros comme des pamplemousses, rafales folles… et parfois, des tornades."
- duration: 8.093s

- src: compositions/frames/09-supercellule.html
- type: benefit_highlight
- persuasion: Build-up (climax de la liste) + Concretization (pamplemousse)
- beat: Awe + fear
- blueprint: compose
- focal: the supercell silhouette with its rotating updraft
- roles: ORANGE register · listicle chrome "TYPE 4 / 4" + dots (fourth filled, ink) = supporting · "le roi" → "supercellule" (ink, display→h1 token swap) = foreground subject · massive ink supercell silhouette (wide base, tower, anvil, overshooting top) = foreground subject · ink spiral inside the updraft + mono "ROTATION" = supporting · giant hailstone (ink circle with segment lines, the grapefruit) + mono "GRÊLON = PAMPLEMOUSSE" = supporting · ink chevrons "RAFALES" = supporting · ink tornado funnel + mono "TORNADE" = foreground payoff

narrativeRole: Le sommet de la liste : l'orage le plus puissant, avec ce qui le rend unique (la rotation).
keyMessage: La supercellule, avec son ascendance en rotation, est l'orage le plus violent : grosse grêle et tornades.

Compose: opens on an in-place token swap ("le roi" → "supercellule"); the payoff is a non-text element (the supercell + tornado).
Scene 1 (0.0–1.9s): fire-orange field; chrome top-left "TYPE 4 / 4" (ink). "le roi" lands in ink display at y≈330 on 0.3s, then hard-cut token swap to h1 "supercellule" on 0.8s (`discrete-text-sequence`).
Scene 2 (1.9–4.2s): on "courant ascendant" the massive ink supercell silhouette rises into frame (y≈560–1450, ~90% width) with a smooth long-tail settle; on "tourne sur lui-même" (2.9s) an orange-on-ink spiral (cut-out of the silhouette, drawn in fire-orange) draws itself inside the updraft (`svg-path-draw`) and rotates ~270° once (finite), mono "ROTATION" beside it.
Scene 3 (4.2–5.7s): on "grêlons" a giant hailstone drops from the anvil to y≈1250 at the right side; on "pamplemousses" (5.0s) mono "GRÊLON = PAMPLEMOUSSE" appears next to it.
Scene 4 (5.7–8.09s): on "rafales folles" ink chevrons shoot left from the base (`motion-blur-streak`); on "tornades" (7.1s) an ink tornado funnel descends from the cloud base to the ground (scaleY from top, `power3`) with a quick ink-flash punch, mono "TORNADE". Hold.

# Discrete Text Sequence

Instead of character-by-character typewriter, replace entire string states at time thresholds — enabling non-linear effects (typos, backspaces, bulk paste, "thinking" gaps) that smooth per-char typing can't achieve. If your effect is "type each character, no edits", this rule is overkill — use the smooth-slice variation below.

## How It Works

The typing is authored as a sparse array of `{ t, text }` states; on every `onUpdate` a **reverse search** finds the latest entry whose `t` has passed and renders its text. Display jumps between states with no animation between them — the realism comes from the schedule shape: fast keystroke clusters (0.06–0.20s apart), pauses at word breaks (0.3–0.6s), a typo, backspaces peeling back to the fork, then a bulk paste replacing many chars in one entry. A block cursor blinks via a deterministic sin square wave on the same timeline.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="prompt">$</div>
  <div class="text-wrap">
    <span class="text" id="text"></span><span class="cursor" id="cursor">_</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.terminal {
  font-family: {monoFont}; /* monospace required — proportional jitters even in a fixed box */
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  font-size: TERMINAL_FONT_SIZE;
}
.text-wrap {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  min-width: TEXT_WRAP_MIN_WIDTH; /* ≥ widest state — stops right-edge jitter */
  white-space: nowrap;
}
.cursor {
  display: inline-block; /* inline ignores width */
  width: CURSOR_WIDTH;
}
```

```js
// Each entry shows from its t until the NEXT entry's t.
// Shape: keystrokes → typo → backspace to the fork → bulk paste → completion mark.
const SEQUENCE = [
  { t: 0.0, text: "" },
  { t: T_K1, text: "{p1}" }, // first keystrokes (~3-5 chars, 0.1-0.2s apart)
  { t: T_K2, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_typo}" }, // continuation containing a typo
  { t: T_BS, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_partial}" }, // backspace(s) — peel back to the fork
  { t: T_BULK, text: "{fullCorrectedText}" }, // bulk paste — many chars in one jump
  { t: T_DONE, text: "{fullCorrectedText + ' ✓'}" }, // completion marker
];

// Reverse-search for the latest entry whose t has passed
function textAt(time) {
  for (let i = SEQUENCE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= SEQUENCE[i].t) return SEQUENCE[i].text;
  }
  return "";
}

const textEl = document.getElementById("text");
const cursorEl = document.getElementById("cursor");

const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = textAt(driver.t);
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Cursor blink — deterministic sin square wave, never a CSS animation
const blink = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  blink,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BLINK_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      cursorEl.style.opacity = Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Smooth character slice** (continuous typewriter — no pauses, no edits): faster to author but uniformly "machine-typed", missing the human realism:

```js
const fullText = "{fullPhrase}";
const len = { v: 0 };
tl.to(
  len,
  {
    v: fullText.length,
    duration: TYPE_DUR,
    ease: "power1.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = fullText.substring(0, Math.floor(len.v));
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

- **Thinking pause** — hold one state for `THINK_HOLD_DUR` (0.8–2.0s; under 0.5s reads as a stutter, not thought) simply by leaving a gap before the next entry's `t`.
- **State pulse on completion** — when the final state lands, `tl.to(".text", { scale: 1.03–1.08, duration: 0.15–0.3, yoyo: true, repeat: 1 }, T_DONE)`.
- **Per-state color shift** — in `onUpdate`, branch on `driver.t` vs the milestones: success color after `T_DONE`, dim mid-edit, normal while typing.

## Critical Constraints

- **Reverse-search the array each frame** — O(n) with small n (≤30 typical); don't index by frame, the sequence is sparse.
- **`min-width` on the text wrap is mandatory** — without it the right edge jitters as state length changes.
- **Discrete jumps must be INSTANT** — any transition on the text turns the jump into a smear and kills the "typing" feel.
- **Cursor blink is sin/sequence-driven on the timeline**, `display: inline-block`, monospace font, `white-space: nowrap` (wrapping mid-state breaks the illusion; trailing spaces must survive).
- **Discrete vs smooth** — use discrete only for non-linear states (typos, pauses, bulk paste); plain typing takes the smooth-slice variation.

name: motion-blur-streak
description: Fake directional velocity blur on a fast entrance or camera push-through — blur peaks at max speed and resolves to 0 at the settle, so the element streaks in then snaps sharp. Two paths — SVG feGaussianBlur on the motion axis, or an echo/ghost trail that collapses into the lead. Plus a per-frame-driven form for an element riding a baked track (tracked insert, shake-matched title): velocity-gated text-free silhouette ghosts (or a rotate/blur/counter-rotate filter sandwich when a true blur is the look), streak axis from the track delta.

# Motion-Blur Streak

Real motion blur isn't available to a seeked renderer (it integrates over shutter time), so this rule **fakes** it for a fast fly-in or hard camera push-through. The whole point is the _coupling_: the blur envelope rides the **same ease and window** as the position tween, so peak blur lands exactly on peak speed and the element is razor-sharp the instant it stops. Two paths:

- **(A) Directional SVG blur** — inline `<feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="X 0">` (X on the motion axis, 0 across it), tweened via a proxy. Cleanest; a true directional smear.
- **(B) Echo / ghost trail** — 2–4 duplicates at decreasing opacity, offset backward along the motion vector, collapsing into the lead as it settles. No filter cost; a stylized "speed-line" trail.

Both paths assume a **tween window** — an element driven per frame from a baked track has none; that form is the Per-Frame-Driven Carve-In below.

**Entrances and mid-shot moves only — never a mid-composition exit.** A blurred element fleeing off-frame mid-composition reads as a glitch; a hard exit between scenes is the transition's job (`../transitions/overview.md`). Two sanctioned scope extensions: the envelope may ride the **camera wrapper** during a travel leg (Camera-Travel Carve-Out), or become a per-frame function of a baked track for a **driven element** (Per-Frame-Driven Carve-In).

## How It Works

A fast `out`-eased move front-loads velocity — fastest off the start, bleeding to zero at the settle. Map the blur/echo envelope onto that same curve: position travels from an off-frame / pushed-back start to rest over `MOVE_DUR`; in lockstep on the same window and ease the smear goes `PEAK_BLUR → 0` (A) or the ghosts collapse onto the lead (B). By the settle the element is fully crisp and dwells ≥1 s — the contrast between violent streak and still, sharp settle IS the effect. GSAP can't tween an SVG attribute directly: tween a plain `{ v }` proxy and write `setAttribute("stdDeviation", …)` in `onUpdate`, seeding it once at setup so a seek to t=0 shows the streaked start.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip; overflow: hidden on the scene (the smear extends past rest) -->
<svg width="0" height="0" aria-hidden="true" style="position: absolute">
  <filter id="streak" x="-50%" y="-50%" width="200%" height="200%">
    <feGaussianBlur id="streak-blur" in="SourceGraphic" stdDeviation="0 0" />
  </filter>
</svg>
<div class="streak-el" id="streak-el" style="filter: url(#streak)">{phrase}</div>
<!-- Path B instead: N-1 aria-hidden .streak-ghost duplicates BEHIND the lead, no filter -->
```

```js
// Path A — proxy-tweened directional blur.
const blurNode = document.getElementById("streak-blur");
const blurProxy = { v: PEAK_BLUR };
const writeBlur = () => blurNode.setAttribute("stdDeviation", `${blurProxy.v} 0`); // X axis only
writeBlur(); // seed frame 0 — a seek to t=0 must show the streaked start, not a sharp pre-frame

tl.fromTo(
  "#streak-el",
  { x: ENTER_FROM_X, opacity: 0 },
  { x: 0, opacity: 1, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE },
  MOVE_START,
);
tl.to(blurProxy, { v: 0, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE, onUpdate: writeBlur }, MOVE_START);

// Path B — ghosts on the SAME window/ease; per-ghost variation by index.
gsap.utils.toArray(".streak-ghost").forEach((g) => {
  const i = Number(g.dataset.i); // 1..N-1, set in HTML
  tl.fromTo(
    g,
    { x: ENTER_FROM_X - i * ECHO_STEP_PX, opacity: GHOST_BASE_OPACITY / i },
    { x: 0, opacity: 0, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE },
    MOVE_START,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Vertical streak** — swap axes: `y`, `stdDeviation="0 Y"`, vertical echo offsets.
- **Camera push-through** — `scale: SCALE_FROM → 1` with a symmetric `"B B"` envelope (depth-wise smear, not directional): the wordmark punches out of soft focus and snaps crisp at the lock.
- **Staggered grid streak-in** — each card streaks into its slot at `MOVE_START + i * CARD_STAGGER` with its own blur proxy / ghosts; sharp the instant it lands.
- **Hold-the-streak** — blur on a marginally slower curve than position (position `expo.out`, blur `power3.out`) so the last wisp resolves just after arrival. Sparingly; default is locked envelopes.

## Camera-Travel Carve-Out

The envelope is also sanctioned at **wrapper level**: on the `.world` / camera wrapper of a virtual-camera scene ([viewport-change.md](viewport-change.md), [multi-phase-camera.md](multi-phase-camera.md), [3d-camera-flight.md](3d-camera-flight.md)) during a **travel leg** — a dive, a whip sweep, a violent final push. This does **not** violate "never a mid-composition exit": the world never leaves frame — the camera travels _through_ it, and every leg ends with the world at rest, sharp, inside the frame. Each leg is an **arrival** at the next pose, so the entrance doctrine applies leg by leg. Three deltas from the element-level recipe:

- **Envelope follows the leg's ease.** An `out` leg (dive, final push) uses the base recipe unchanged. An `inOut` repositioning leg peaks mid-leg: split the envelope at the velocity peak — `0 → PEAK` on the in-half ease over the first half, `PEAK → 0` on the out-half over the second. Seed the proxy at **0** for these (the streaked state lives mid-leg, not at t=0; seed-at-`PEAK_BLUR` belongs to the entrance shape, where the first frame IS the fastest).
- **Filter placement.** 2D camera: `filter: url(#streak)` on the `.world` wrapper. 3D flight: on the **perspective stage** above the 3D context — a `filter` on a `preserve-3d` element flattens it and collapses every `translateZ`. Never per-element inside the world: one frame-wide envelope, not N desynced ones.
- **Full-frame blur is heavy** — cap `PEAK_BLUR` ~18–20 at wrapper level (vs 30 for one element); a brief whip may touch ~24. Axis rule as usual: `"X 0"` for a lateral whip/pan, `"B B"` for a dive/push.

### Whip sweep (named composition)

The heavily-blurred lateral whip that resolves into the next region — two rules on one window:

1. **Position** — [nudge-curve.md](nudge-curve.md)'s three-phase chain on the camera state, tuned burst-dominant (tail still ≥3× ramp-in in time).
2. **Blur** — `0 → PEAK` across the ramp-in, held at `PEAK` through the linear burst (constant velocity = constant smear), `PEAK → 0` across the tail.

Swap or reveal the next region's content DURING the burst — the smear masks the change; the `power4.out` tail lands it sharp. Reveal during the burst, read after the tail.

```js
tl.to(cam, { x: WHIP_X * 0.1, duration: 0.12, ease: "power3.in", onUpdate: applyCamera }, WHIP_AT);
tl.to(
  cam,
  { x: WHIP_X * 0.75, duration: 0.1, ease: "none", onUpdate: applyCamera },
  WHIP_AT + 0.12,
);
tl.to(
  cam,
  { x: WHIP_X, duration: 0.35, ease: "power4.out", onUpdate: applyCamera },
  WHIP_AT + 0.22,
);

tl.to(blurProxy, { v: PEAK_BLUR, duration: 0.12, ease: "power3.in", onUpdate: writeBlur }, WHIP_AT);
// blur holds at PEAK through the linear burst (no tween needed — value rests at PEAK)
tl.to(blurProxy, { v: 0, duration: 0.35, ease: "power4.out", onUpdate: writeBlur }, WHIP_AT + 0.22);
```

## Per-Frame-Driven Carve-In (baked tracks)

When the element is not tweened but **driven** — a tracked insert or callout riding a baked per-frame track, a title matched to camera shake — there is no move window to share. The envelope becomes a per-frame function of the track's own delta, computed in the same `onUpdate` that applies the position.

One element per transform, so no write clobbers another:

```html
<!-- .track: position + any fade, the only element either touches -->
<div class="track">
  <!-- ×2, the lead's box -->
  <div class="streak-ghost" aria-hidden="true" data-layout-allow-overlap></div>
  <!-- Path A only: rotate onto the travel axis; same box as .lead so both rotate about one center -->
  <div class="blur-wrap" style="filter: url(#streak)">
    <!-- counter-rotate only; no GSAP transform tweens on it -->
    <div class="lead">…</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
// inside the frame-lookup driver (an ease:"none" proxy → frames[i]); TRACK.x / TRACK.y are baked arrays
const j = Math.max(1, i); // frame 0 borrows the frame-1 delta so a seek to t=0 has a defined state
const dx = TRACK.x[j] - TRACK.x[j - 1];
const dy = TRACK.y[j] - TRACK.y[j - 1];
const speed = Math.hypot(dx, dy); // px per frame
const angle = (Math.atan2(dy, dx) * 180) / Math.PI; // the streak axis IS the travel direction
track.style.transform = `translate(${TRACK.x[i]}px, ${TRACK.y[i]}px)`;

// Path B, driven form (the default here): text-free silhouette clones trail the lead along −delta.
const base = speed > TRAIL_GATE ? Math.min(TRAIL_MAX, TRAIL_K * speed) : 0;
ghost1.style.transform = `translate(${-dx * 0.25}px, ${-dy * 0.25}px)`;
ghost2.style.transform = `translate(${-dx * 0.5}px, ${-dy * 0.5}px)`;
ghost1.style.opacity = String(base); // a fade on .track multiplies in; never read another tween's value
ghost2.style.opacity = String(base * 0.5);

// Path A, driven form: rotate a filter wrapper onto the travel axis, blur along X only, counter-rotate the content.
const sigma = speed > TRAIL_GATE ? Math.min(SIGMA_MAX, 0.5 * speed) : 0;
blurWrap.style.transform = `rotate(${angle}deg)`;
lead.style.transform = `rotate(${-angle}deg)`;
blurNode.setAttribute("stdDeviation", `${sigma} 0`);
```

Three deltas from the tweened recipe:

- **Ghosts are text-free silhouettes** — the lead's box, border, radius and fill with **no content** (`aria-hidden="true"`, `data-layout-allow-overlap`). A 25–50%-opacity clone reads as shape; a clone carrying the text reads as a duplicate element, and content-free clones give the layout and contrast checkers nothing to flag.
- **Velocity-gated, not window-shaped** — the trail exists only above `TRAIL_GATE` px/frame and scales with speed (`min(TRAIL_MAX, TRAIL_K × speed)`): a slow drift shows nothing, a whip shows a 180°-shutter smear. Fade `.track`, never `.lead`: group opacity takes the trail with it, and the ghost opacity stays a pure function of the frame index whatever order frames are seeked in.
- **Axis from the baked delta** — `atan2(dy, dx)` per frame; the streak follows the track around corners with nothing to seed at setup.

**Which path for a driven subtree.** Path B is the default: it costs no filter raster (a full filter region re-rasterizes every frame under per-frame drive), its clones carry no text so the layout and contrast checkers see nothing new, and it degrades to nothing when the track is still. Path A in the driven form is legitimate when a true blur is the look. Both forms measured deterministic on the reference host (2026-09-08: single-card 120-frame and three-card 450-frame drives of each path, hardware-GL and software lanes, every double render bit-identical) — but a per-frame-driven filter is the first thing to re-measure on a new host: keep the double-render frame-hash comparison (`--format png-sequence` twice) in the pipeline rather than trusting one clean run. One earlier build (2026-08) observed 1-LSB `feGaussianBlur` jitter under per-frame load and shipped Path B for that reason.

## Critical Constraints

- Blur peaks at peak speed and resolves to 0 at the settle — share the ease and window between position and envelope. A blur that lingers after the stop reads as a focus pull.
- Entrances / mid-shot arrivals only — never a mid-composition exit; wrapper-level use only per the Camera-Travel Carve-Out, per-frame-driven use only per the Per-Frame-Driven Carve-In.
- Seed `stdDeviation` at setup: at `PEAK_BLUR` for the entrance shape, at 0 for a whip / `inOut` leg.
- Generous filter region (`x="-50%" y="-50%" width="200%" height="200%"`) or the smear clips at the element's box edge.
- Directional axis: `"X 0"` horizontal, `"0 Y"` vertical, `"B B"` only for a depth/scale move — symmetric blur on a sideways move looks like defocus.
- Dwell ≥1 s sharp after the snap; a streak landing at the last beat reads as "flashed and gone".
- Heavy element on a solid field — thin type (< ~120px / 800 weight) or a busy backdrop swallows the smear.
- `overflow: hidden` on the scene — the smear / furthest ghost extends past the resting position during travel.
- Driven form: clones are text-free silhouettes (`aria-hidden`, `data-layout-allow-overlap`) inside the faded `.track`, axis from the baked delta; nothing is seeded at setup except the structural frame-0 state.

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

## Values

| token             | range                                   | notes                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR  | 0.3–0.8s                                | fast snap vs deliberate pen trace; >~1s feels sluggish for a logo reveal                           |
| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.

- focal: the comment bubble that becomes the subscribe button
- roles: ORANGE register · ink-OUTLINED speech bubble (sharp rectangle + tail, 6px ink stroke, no fill) with ink h2 "ton pire orage ?" inside = foreground subject · small ink lightning glyph = supporting · mono "↓ EN COMMENTAIRE" = supporting · solid ink CTA button with fire-orange "s'abonner" label (the one ink block) = foreground payoff · thin ink tap-ripple rings = supporting · mono sign-off "MÉTÉO · CLIMAT" = supporting

narrativeRole: Transforme la vidéo en conversation (commentaires) et en abonnement.
keyMessage: Commente ton pire orage et abonne-toi.

Adapt: keep the signature "mark condenses in place into a brighter CTA, then a human-aimed press lands"; no cursor — a tap ripple stands in for the click.
Scene 1 (0.0–1.9s): fire-orange field; an ink-outlined speech bubble pops in at y≈380–760 (`spring-pop-entrance`, smooth) and h2 "ton pire orage ?" builds per-word inside it on 0.8–1.3s; a small ink lightning glyph strikes into its corner.
Scene 2 (1.9–3.2s): on "en commentaire" mono "↓ EN COMMENTAIRE" types on under the bubble (y≈820).
Scene 3 (3.2–5.87s): on "abonne-toi" the bubble condenses at the same center into a solid ink button (`card-morph-anchor` / scale-swap) at y≈1050–1230 reading "s'abonner" in fire-orange Barlow h2; at 4.2s a tap lands — `press-release-spring` compression + two thin ink ripple rings; the label swaps to "abonné ✓" at 4.5s; mono sign-off "MÉTÉO · CLIMAT" at y≈1400. Final frame: hold to the end (a gentle final settle is allowed).

## Selected blueprint: cta-morph-press

# cta-morph-press — CTA Morph & Press

**intent**: A resting brand mark condenses at the same screen center into a smaller, brighter CTA, then a cursor arrives from off-stage and lands a human-aimed click on it. The viewer's eye is walked from "this is who we are" to "and this is what you do." The morph and the click are the two headline beats.

**roles served**

- CTA (from `cta-morph-press`): when the close moves from brand identity to a single user action, two elements share the same center sequentially (a morph, not a cut), and the payoff is a simulated click with physical feedback. Reach for it for a focused "click here" sign-off — no spatial set, no multi-step UI (that's `cursor-ui-demo`).
- Hook (ROLE-WIDENED, from `widget-morph-on-blank-field`): the same
  machinery run as an OPENER — a lone `[widget]` (pill / chip lockup) on a flat field transforms
  in place, performs its payload, then vanishes to a plain frame that a typed `[title]` resolves.
  The click, when present, ignites the morph rather than closing it; there may be no cursor at
  all. Reach for it when the product hook IS one widget doing one thing — still no spatial set,
  no multi-step UI (that's `cursor-ui-demo`). Mint-reconsideration trigger: if future mining
  brings 2+ more widget-morph openers with the vanish → typed-title resolve, promote this variant
  to its own blueprint (the beat order is fully inverted by then).

**duration**: 4–6s (Hook widget-morph opener 5–7.5s)

**shot structure** (a `[bg]` canvas; hero and CTA are flex-centered siblings sharing one `transform-origin`)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~1.4s) — presence.** The `[hero mark / brand lockup]` holds dead-center, alive but resting — only a faint rotational breath on the mark; any title text under it stays rock-stable. Camera static.
- **Scene 2 (~1.4–2.4s) — the morph (signature move).** The hero CONDENSES at the same screen center into a smaller, brighter `[CTA]` (button / card): the outgoing mark shrink-fades exactly as the CTA scales up in its place. Because they share one `transform-origin`, the eye reads it as one element transforming, not a swap.
- **Scene 3 (~2.4–3.4s) — approach.** A `[cursor]` arrives from off-stage on a **decelerating** path (it "arrives," it does not pass through) and lands a few px **off** the CTA's geometric center, so the aim reads human, not scripted.
- **Scene 4 (~3.4–end) — press.** The cursor lands a physical CLICK — cursor and CTA compress together in lockstep, then release with feedback (an optional ripple / glow bloom). Holds on the clicked state.
- **Variant — Hook (widget-morph opener)** (from `widget-morph-on-blank-field`;
  reorders the beats — press first, morph second, title last). **(1) presence**: a lone
  `[pill / chip lockup]` sits centered on a flat `[field]`; optionally the `[cursor]` glides in, a
  hover pill-background appears behind the chip, and the click lands with the same lockstep press.
  **(2) the morph**: the widget transforms IN PLACE — expands downward anchored at its top edge
  into a `[menu]`, or spring-morphs outward into a `[prompt card]` with a small overshoot settle —
  new content fades/slides into place. **(3) payload**: the transformed state performs —
  `[placeholder]` types with a blinking caret, `[user text]` types while a control flips from
  muted to its vibrant active color, or the menu snap-collapses back to the pill carrying the
  `[new value]` + a checkmark pop; the background may snap to a new color under the persistent
  foreground card. **(4) resolve**: the widget VANISHES; a plain frame closes the beat — a
  `[closing title]` types on center, or a hold on the flipped solid.

**motion vocabulary**: faint rotation-only resting breath (logo scope only); same-center morph-swap (shrink-fade ↔ scale-up sharing `transform-origin`); cursor decel-arrival from off-stage; off-center human aim; lockstep press compression; release feedback ripple / glow. Hook opener: anchored downward expand of a pill into a menu and springy snap-collapse back;
chip-to-card spring morph with overshoot settle; placeholder / user-text typewriter with blinking
caret (may cut mid-word); control color-state flip muted → vibrant; background color snap under a
persistent foreground card; checkmark pop; widget vanish to blank frame; typed closing title.

**rule mapping**

- hero → CTA condense at one center → `scale-swap-transition` (shared `transform-origin: 50% 50%` is what sells the morph; CTA `position: absolute` so it doesn't shove the hero during the brief overlap)
- resting-hero aliveness (rotation only, scoped to the mark so the Phase-2 scale doesn't fight it) → `sine-wave-loop` (low-amplitude rotation register — subtle jitter, not a scale breath)
- cursor press + release in lockstep (single-target-array so both compress together) → `physics-press-reaction` (PRESS_DOWN + RELEASE portion)
- cursor approach (decel from off-stage, off-center landing, hard-cut opacity in) → `gsap-effects` (translate on `power2.out`)
- click ripple / release glow → `cursor-click-ripple` (attack-decay ring) and/or `ambient-glow-bloom` (release bloom)
- (Hook) chip → prompt-card spring morph at one center → `scale-swap-transition` (the base morph
  contract, run in the expand direction) + `card-morph-anchor` (corner-radius / surface ride-along)
- (Hook) anchored-edge expand / snap-collapse (pill ↔ menu, top edge pinned) →
  `anchored-layout-expand` (edge-anchored directional container growth — origin-pinned expansion
  with counter-scaled children; `card-morph-anchor` stays for uniform-scale morphs only)
- (Hook) placeholder + user typing, blinking caret, mid-word cut → `gsap-effects` (typewriter) +
  `context-sensitive-cursor` (blink) + `discrete-text-sequence` (mid-word cut states)
- (Hook) control color flip muted → vibrant → `press-release-spring` (color-transition variation)
- (Hook) checkmark pop / card-arrival overshoot → `spring-pop-entrance`
- (Hook) hover pill-background + igniting click → the base's `physics-press-reaction` +
  `cursor-click-ripple` mappings apply unchanged

**camera modifier**: camera-static — the morph and click happen in element space; a camera move would compete with the click as the climax. The Hook opener keeps the same contract — even the background color flip is an element-level
snap, not a camera event.

# Card Morph Anchor

A free-floating container morphs apparent size, corner radius, and surface treatment between two shots — the morph itself IS the transition; the viewer's eye tracks the persistent container. Distinct from [anchored-layout-expand.md](anchored-layout-expand.md) (an edge-pinned live layout participant that grows along one axis and reflows neighbors — here nothing is pushed) and [theme-crossfade-morph.md](theme-crossfade-morph.md) (a whole-theme reskin under a fixed anchor — here a single container changes shape).

## How It Works

Since `width`/`height` tweens are forbidden, **substitute uniform `scale` for apparent size**; the remaining morph channels are **paint-only**: `borderRadius`, `background`, `boxShadow`. All channels ride ONE tween (one ease, one duration) so the shape morphs in lockstep. Content choreography: old content fades out during the first ~40% of the morph, new content fades in during the last ~40% — the shape-only gap between is the natural "blink." Optionally the morph card itself fades at the very end, revealing the real next-shot element rendered behind it.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<!-- DOM order = stacking: the anchor renders BEFORE the card, so the card is on top -->
<div class="next-shot-anchor"><img src="{nextShotAnchor}" alt="anchor" /></div>
<div class="morph-card">
  <div class="content-old">{shotOneContent}</div>
  <div class="content-new">{shotTwoContent}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.morph-card {
  width: SHOT_ONE_W;
  height: SHOT_ONE_H; /* shot-1 geometry; the morph is scale, never width/height */
  border-radius: SHOT_ONE_RADIUS;
  background: {surfaceShotOne};
  overflow: hidden; /* content must clip during the shape change */
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  will-change: transform;
}
.content-old,
.content-new {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
.content-new {
  opacity: 0; /* author its inner sizes at apparent-size ÷ END_SCALE — it scales with the card */
}
.next-shot-anchor {
  position: absolute;
  opacity: 0; /* fades in as the morph card fades out */
}
```

```js
const END_SCALE = SHOT_TWO_W / SHOT_ONE_W; // uniform — keep the two shots aspect-matched

// Hold shot 1 for HOLD_BEAT first — an instant morph reads as glitchy.

// One tween, all channels: uniform scale + paint-only properties.
tl.to(
  ".morph-card",
  {
    scale: END_SCALE,
    borderRadius: SHOT_TWO_RADIUS / END_SCALE, // borderRadius is pre-scale — divide to land the APPARENT radius
    background: "{surfaceShotTwo}",
    boxShadow: "{shadowShotTwo}",
    duration: MORPH_DUR,
    ease: "power2.inOut",
  },
  MORPH_START,
);

tl.to(
  ".content-old",
  { opacity: 0, duration: MORPH_DUR * OLD_FADE_FRAC, ease: "power1.in" },
  MORPH_START,
);
tl.to(
  ".content-new",
  { opacity: 1, duration: MORPH_DUR * NEW_FADE_FRAC, ease: "power1.out" },
  MORPH_START + MORPH_DUR * (1 - NEW_FADE_FRAC),
);

// Optional handoff — card fades out over the pixel-identical real anchor.
tl.to(
  ".morph-card",
  { opacity: 0, duration: MORPH_DUR * FINAL_FADE_FRAC, ease: "power1.in", immediateRender: false },
  MORPH_START + MORPH_DUR * (1 - FINAL_FADE_FRAC),
);
tl.to(
  ".next-shot-anchor",
  { opacity: 1, duration: MORPH_DUR * FINAL_FADE_FRAC, ease: "power1.out" },
  MORPH_START + MORPH_DUR * (1 - FINAL_FADE_FRAC),
);
```

## Morph channels

| channel        | how                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| apparent size  | uniform `scale` — the substitution for the forbidden `width`/`height` tween; aspect preserved  |
| `borderRadius` | paint-only; pre-scale units — tween to `APPARENT_RADIUS / END_SCALE`, ≤ half the smaller side  |
| `background`   | paint-only; gradients interpolate only with equal stop counts (solid→solid: `backgroundColor`) |
| `boxShadow`    | paint-only; base shadow → accent glow shifts emphasis                                          |

## Variations

- **Landing on a non-centered target** (dock icon, sidebar slot): add `x`/`y` to the same tween, computed as the FLIP-style delta between the card's and the target's rects — `getBoundingClientRect()` both at build time (single-scene only, per the contract) and tween the difference. Don't hand-compute from CSS values: paddings, borders, and parent transforms compound, and center-vs-edge arithmetic is the classic off-by-half bug.
- **Aspect change between shots**: uniform scale preserves aspect — morph to the nearest uniform fit and let the crossfade/handoff absorb the small delta, or drop the handoff and hold the card's final state.

## Values

| token             | range                     | notes                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| HOLD_BEAT         | 0.6–1.5s                  | ≥ shot 1's entry settle; the viewer must register shot 1 first                       |
| MORPH_DUR         | 0.6–1.2s                  | < 0.5s can't fit both content fades                                                  |
| END_SCALE         | SHOT_TWO_W / SHOT_ONE_W   | icon-sized handoffs typically land at 80–400px apparent width                        |
| SHOT_TWO_RADIUS   | ≤ min(W, H)/2 apparent    | half the smaller side = perfect circle; beyond is clamped                            |
| OLD/NEW_FADE_FRAC | 0.3–0.5 each, sum ≤ 1     | the gap between is the shape-only "blink"                                            |
| FINAL_FADE_FRAC   | 0 (no handoff) or 0.1–0.2 | only when a pixel-identical anchor exists                                            |
| ease              | `power2.inOut` canonical  | `power3`/`expo.inOut` OK; never `back`/`elastic` — overshoot fights the shape change |

## Critical Constraints

- **❗ Uniform-scale substitution** — never tween `width`/`height`; `scale` + the paint-only channels (`borderRadius`, `background`, `boxShadow`) are the ONLY morph properties.
- **❗ Handoff anchor must be pixel-identical to the card's final state** — same apparent size, radius, background, shadow, inner icon dimensions. Any delta = a visible pop during the crossfade. Can't match exactly? Drop the handoff and hold the morph card.
- **❗ Stacking by DOM order, never a z-index snap mid-fade** — render the anchor before the card; a `tl.set({ zIndex })` during an active opacity tween flips stacking before the fade finishes and flickers.
- **`overflow: hidden`** on the card — content must clip as the radius changes.
- **Hold a beat before morphing**; same ease family for shape and crossfade (mixed eases read unsynchronized).

## Selected motion rule: press-release-spring

# Press-Release Spring Chain

Separates input (linear compression) from output (spring recovery) to create tactile feel: the overshoot is a natural byproduct of the spring config, not manually coded, with secondary motion (shadow shrink, release burst, background glow) layered on the same trigger frame. This is a **reaction on an element already resting on screen** — an arrival that springs in from nothing is [spring-pop-entrance.md](spring-pop-entrance.md); add a visible cursor actor and it becomes [physics-press-reaction.md](physics-press-reaction.md).

Two phases split at the **release**:

1. **Press**: linear ease → compression (`scale: 1 → PRESS_SCALE`, shadow shrinks). Linear, not spring — the dip must read as instant/tactile, not squishy.
2. **Release**: `back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` spring back to 1.0. Optional burst glow ring expands behind the button; optional environmental glow fades in.

State continuity is critical: the release tween's start value MUST equal the press tween's end value, or the spring snaps to a different position. GSAP threads this automatically when both tweens target the same property at **adjacent positions** — `RELEASE_START = PRESS_START + PRESS_DUR`; a gap or overlap breaks it.

## Recipe

```html
<div class="press-stage">
  <div class="bg-glow" id="bg-glow"></div>
  <!-- Burst sits BEHIND the button (z-index 1 vs 2), same footprint, blurred
       radial gradient, opacity 0. bg-glow is a full-stage radial at negative
       inset so it extends past the stage edges. -->
  <div class="burst" id="burst"></div>
  <button class="btn" id="btn">{buttonLabel}</button>
</div>
```

```js
// Phase 1 — press (linear compression)
tl.to(
  "#btn",
  { scale: PRESS_SCALE, boxShadow: "{btnPressedShadow}", duration: PRESS_DUR, ease: "power1.in" },
  PRESS_START,
);

// Phase 2 — release (spring back; start scale == PRESS_SCALE by adjacency)
tl.to(
  "#btn",
  {
    scale: 1,
    boxShadow: "{btnRestShadow}",
    duration: RELEASE_DUR,
    ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})`,
  },
  RELEASE_START,
);

// Phase 3 — burst glow pops behind the button, then fades
tl.fromTo(
  "#burst",
  { scale: 1, opacity: 0 },
  {
    scale: BURST_PEAK_SCALE,
    opacity: BURST_PEAK_OPACITY,
    duration: BURST_GROW_DUR,
    ease: "power2.out",
  },
  RELEASE_START,
);
tl.to("#burst", { opacity: 0, duration: BURST_FADE_DUR, ease: "power2.in" }, BURST_FADE_START);

// Phase 4 — environmental glow fades in after release
tl.to(
  "#bg-glow",
  { opacity: BG_GLOW_PEAK_OPACITY, duration: BG_GLOW_FADE_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  RELEASE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Subtle press** (status save / muted CTA): `PRESS_SCALE` ~0.96, `BOUNCE_FACTOR` ~1.4, burst scale/opacity reduced.
- **Dramatic press** (hero CTA / "ship it"): `PRESS_SCALE` ~0.88, `BOUNCE_FACTOR` ~2.5, burst maxed.
- **Color shift during press** — darken mid-press, return on release; interpolated `backgroundColor` at the same timeline positions as the scale tweens. Same state-continuity rule.
- **State change at release** (approve / confirm) — instead of returning to the rest color, swap to `{successColor}` at `RELEASE_START` and pop a checkmark via a separate `back.out(CHECK_BOUNCE)` tween (1.4–2.0, firmer than the button's bounce — a punctuating "stamp"; pop 0.3–0.6 s) at the same position. The button is now terminal — no further presses expected.

Color tokens: pressed surface darker than rest; rest shadow large + diffuse, pressed small + tight (the button "sinks toward the surface"); burst gradient darker + more saturated than `{btnBg}` — same-color glow looks washed out; bg glow a low-opacity tint of the button's hue family.

## Critical Constraints

- **State continuity** — release start value exactly equals press end value; enforced by same-property adjacency at `RELEASE_START = PRESS_START + PRESS_DUR`.
- **Linear press, spring release** — both spring → squishy; both linear → mechanical, no overshoot punch.
- **Anchor compression on center** (`transform-origin: 50% 50%`) or the button collapses asymmetrically.
- **Burst behind, not in front** — burst `z-index: 1`, button `z-index: 2`; in front it occludes the button at peak opacity.
- **Don't tween `boxShadow` and `filter` on the same element** — they compete in the layout pipeline; shadow on the button, blur on the separate burst layer.
- **Climax dwell** — after the burst peak + reveal, the composition must run ≥ 1 s more (≥ 2 s for dramatic variants); a reveal at `t = DURATION − 0.2 s` reads as "flashed and gone."

# Spring-Pop Entrance

> **Smooth beats bouncy.** This entrance defaults to a smooth long-tail settle — `power3.out` (or `expo.out` for a faster front) — that decelerates cleanly into the resting size with **no overshoot**. Bouncy `back.out` is the **#1 instant turn-off** in agent-made videos and is almost never executed well; it is a rare, explicitly-playful exception (consumer / fun brand), never the default. When unsure, settle smoothly.

THE entrance primitive: an element (or staggered group) arrives by springing from nothing — `scale: 0 → 1`, optional small `y` rise — and settles without bouncing. This is **arrival**, not reaction: distinct from [press-release-spring.md](press-release-spring.md) (a click/press → release feedback chain on an element that already rests on screen). Many blueprints used to borrow that rule to fake an entrance; reach for this instead.

## How It Works

One `fromTo` carries the whole arrival: from `{ scale: 0, opacity: 0 }` (explicit, so t=0 is correct under seek) to `{ scale: 1, opacity: 1, ease: "power3.out" }`. For a **group**, the same `fromTo` runs per element at `i * STAGGER`, capped so the group reads as one arriving beat. The `scale` grow is load-bearing; the `y` rise is garnish — drop everything else and it must still read as a clean entrance. Let the ease produce the settle: never hand-key a `scale: 1.1` mid-state (it double-bounces against the curve).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="pop-hero" id="hero">{heroLabel}</div>

<div class="pop-grid">
  <div class="pop-item">{itemA}</div>
  <div class="pop-item">{itemB}</div>
  <div class="pop-item">{itemC}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.pop-hero,
.pop-item {
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* in-place pop; move to the source point for the anchored variation */
  will-change: transform;
}
.pop-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: GRID_GAP;
  place-items: center;
}
```

```js
// Single hero pop — smooth long-tail settle, no overshoot.
tl.fromTo(
  "#hero",
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0 },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  ENTRY_AT,
);

// Staggered group pop — one arriving beat.
gsap.utils.toArray(".pop-item").forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.fromTo(
    el,
    { scale: 0, opacity: 0, y: Y_RISE },
    { scale: 1, opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
    GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Calm settle** (premium / enterprise): `power3.out`, no rotation, `Y_RISE` 0–12px — a weighted, confident landing for a hero wordmark or product shot.
- **Firm settle** (everyday default): `power3.out` or `expo.out` for a punchier front, `Y_RISE` ~24px — cards, icons, callouts.
- **Exact-physics settle**: when the settle IS the shot, swap the ease for `springEase({ response: 0.4 })` (critically damped) from `../adapters/gsap-easing-and-stagger.md` → Spring Eases; take `duration` from the helper.
- **Origin-anchored pop**: a callout growing out of a specific point (marker, pointer tip) sets `transform-origin` to that point (e.g. `0% 100%`) so `scale: 0 → 1` reads as "emerging from the source", not "inflating in place".
- **Pop into a held slot**: land the pop and hold still — no idle loop baked into the entrance. If the held frame genuinely needs life, hand off to [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) for subtle jitter on a separate later tween; prefer revealing the next element on its VO cue.
- **Bouncy pop (RARE — explicitly-playful only)**: swap the ease for `back.out(OVERSHOOT)` and optionally settle a small `rotation: ROT_FROM → 0` so elements look hand-placed. Only for a deliberately playful register — never product / enterprise / serious tone:

```js
tl.fromTo(
  el,
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0, rotation: ROT_FROM },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, rotation: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: `back.out(${OVERSHOOT})` },
  GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
);
```

Even here keep `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2` — past that it reads as cartoon wobble. Better still: the baked spring at `dampingFraction: 0.6–0.7` (same adapters doc) gives ~5–10% overshoot that reads physical where `back.out` reads cartoon.

## Values

| token      | range                                     | notes                                                            |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EASE       | `power3.out` default; `expo.out` punchier | `back.out(OVERSHOOT)` only in the playful variant                |
| POP_DUR    | 0.4–0.7s                                  | shorter = tight snap; hero must be visible by **t ≤ 0.5s**       |
| STAGGER    | 0.04–0.08s                                | `min(0.06, 0.5 / ITEM_COUNT)` — self-caps the window             |
| ITEM_COUNT | 3–9                                       | >9 makes the stagger vanish — switch to a wipe/sweep reveal      |
| Y_RISE     | 0–32px                                    | small; never large enough to read as a slide-up                  |
| ROT_FROM   | −10°–+10°                                 | playful variant only; alternate sign by index (`i % 2 ? 6 : -6`) |
| ENTRY_AT   | 0–0.4s                                    | a beat of quiet, but keep the subject landing by t ≤ 0.5s        |

## Critical Constraints

- Default ease `power3.out` (no overshoot); `back.out` only in the explicitly-playful variant, and there `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2`.
- `ITEM_COUNT × STAGGER ≤ ~0.5s` — the group must land inside one beat.
- Entrances state the collapsed from-state in `fromTo` — never rely on a CSS-hidden start (it renders visible before the tween claims it under seek).
- `transform-origin: 50% 50%` for an in-place pop; the source point only for the anchored variation.
- This is a finite arrival — idle motion on a held element is a separate, later `sine-wave-loop` tween.

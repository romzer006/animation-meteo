- roles: listicle chrome "TYPE 3 / 4" + dots (third filled) = supporting · h1 "ligne de grains" = foreground subject · radar panel (concentric hairline rings + crosshair, dim) = background · bowed line of ~14 storm blobs (cream cores with orange centers) = foreground subject · ruler hairline + mono "CENTAINES DE KM" = supporting · orange chevron arrows + mono "RAFALES" = supporting

narrativeRole: Troisième élément : l'orage passe à l'échelle régionale, la menace devient le vent.
keyMessage: Ligne de grains = orages en ligne sur des centaines de km, rafales violentes.

Scene 1 (0.0–1.5s): chrome top-left (same spot); h1 "ligne de grains" per-word at 0.5–1.0s, y≈260–420; radar panel fades up behind (y≈560–1520, dim rings + crosshair).
Scene 2 (1.5–4.0s): on "alignés" ~14 storm blobs pop in sequence along a bowed line (top→bottom, index-staggered, `waterfall-entry`) at x≈400–560; the whole line then advances right ~120px (one smooth move); on "centaines de kilomètres" (2.7s) a vertical ruler hairline spans the line with mono "CENTAINES DE KM".
Scene 3 (4.0–5.94s): on "rafales" five orange chevron arrows shoot out ahead of the line to the right (`motion-blur-streak`, staggered) and mono "RAFALES" lands at 4.8s. Hold.

## Selected motion rule: motion-blur-streak

---
name: motion-blur-streak
description: Fake directional velocity blur on a fast entrance or camera push-through — blur peaks at max speed and resolves to 0 at the settle, so the element streaks in then snaps sharp. Two paths — SVG feGaussianBlur on the motion axis, or an echo/ghost trail that collapses into the lead. Plus a per-frame-driven form for an element riding a baked track (tracked insert, shake-matched title): velocity-gated text-free silhouette ghosts (or a rotate/blur/counter-rotate filter sandwich when a true blur is the look), streak axis from the track delta.

# Motion-Blur Streak

Real motion blur isn't available to a seeked renderer (it integrates over shutter time), so this rule **fakes** it for a fast fly-in or hard camera push-through. The whole point is the _coupling_: the blur envelope rides the **same ease and window** as the position tween, so peak blur lands exactly on peak speed and the element is razor-sharp the instant it stops. Two paths:

- **(A) Directional SVG blur** — inline `<feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="X 0">` (X on the motion axis, 0 across it), tweened via a proxy. Cleanest; a true directional smear.
- **(B) Echo / ghost trail** — 2–4 duplicates at decreasing opacity, offset backward along the motion vector, collapsing into the lead as it settles. No filter cost; a stylized "speed-line" trail.

Both paths assume a **tween window** — an element driven per frame from a baked track has none; that form is the Per-Frame-Driven Carve-In below.

**Entrances and mid-shot moves only — never a mid-composition exit.** A blurred element fleeing off-frame mid-composition reads as a glitch; a hard exit between scenes is the transition's job (`../transitions/overview.md`). Two sanctioned scope extensions: the envelope may ride the **camera wrapper** during a travel leg (Camera-Travel Carve-Out), or become a per-frame function of a baked track for a **driven element** (Per-Frame-Driven Carve-In).

## How It Works

A fast `out`-eased move front-loads velocity — fastest off the start, bleeding to zero at the settle. Map the blur/echo envelope onto that same curve: position travels from an off-frame / pushed-back start to rest over `MOVE_DUR`; in lockstep on the same window and ease the smear goes `PEAK_BLUR → 0` (A) or the ghosts collapse onto the lead (B). By the settle the element is fully crisp and dwells ≥1 s — the contrast between violent streak and still, sharp settle IS the effect. GSAP can't tween an SVG attribute directly: tween a plain `{ v }` proxy and write `setAttribute("stdDeviation", …)` in `onUpdate`, seeding it once at setup so a seek to t=0 shows the streaked start.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip; overflow: hidden on the scene (the smear extends past rest) -->
<svg width="0" height="0" aria-hidden="true" style="position: absolute">
  <filter id="streak" x="-50%" y="-50%" width="200%" height="200%">
    <feGaussianBlur id="streak-blur" in="SourceGraphic" stdDeviation="0 0" />
  </filter>
</svg>
<div class="streak-el" id="streak-el" style="filter: url(#streak)">{phrase}</div>
<!-- Path B instead: N-1 aria-hidden .streak-ghost duplicates BEHIND the lead, no filter -->
```

```js
// Path A — proxy-tweened directional blur.
const blurNode = document.getElementById("streak-blur");
const blurProxy = { v: PEAK_BLUR };
const writeBlur = () => blurNode.setAttribute("stdDeviation", `${blurProxy.v} 0`); // X axis only
writeBlur(); // seed frame 0 — a seek to t=0 must show the streaked start, not a sharp pre-frame

tl.fromTo(
  "#streak-el",
  { x: ENTER_FROM_X, opacity: 0 },
  { x: 0, opacity: 1, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE },
  MOVE_START,
);
tl.to(blurProxy, { v: 0, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE, onUpdate: writeBlur }, MOVE_START);

// Path B — ghosts on the SAME window/ease; per-ghost variation by index.
gsap.utils.toArray(".streak-ghost").forEach((g) => {
  const i = Number(g.dataset.i); // 1..N-1, set in HTML
  tl.fromTo(
    g,
    { x: ENTER_FROM_X - i * ECHO_STEP_PX, opacity: GHOST_BASE_OPACITY / i },
    { x: 0, opacity: 0, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE },
    MOVE_START,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Vertical streak** — swap axes: `y`, `stdDeviation="0 Y"`, vertical echo offsets.
- **Camera push-through** — `scale: SCALE_FROM → 1` with a symmetric `"B B"` envelope (depth-wise smear, not directional): the wordmark punches out of soft focus and snaps crisp at the lock.
- **Staggered grid streak-in** — each card streaks into its slot at `MOVE_START + i * CARD_STAGGER` with its own blur proxy / ghosts; sharp the instant it lands.
- **Hold-the-streak** — blur on a marginally slower curve than position (position `expo.out`, blur `power3.out`) so the last wisp resolves just after arrival. Sparingly; default is locked envelopes.

## Camera-Travel Carve-Out

The envelope is also sanctioned at **wrapper level**: on the `.world` / camera wrapper of a virtual-camera scene ([viewport-change.md](viewport-change.md), [multi-phase-camera.md](multi-phase-camera.md), [3d-camera-flight.md](3d-camera-flight.md)) during a **travel leg** — a dive, a whip sweep, a violent final push. This does **not** violate "never a mid-composition exit": the world never leaves frame — the camera travels _through_ it, and every leg ends with the world at rest, sharp, inside the frame. Each leg is an **arrival** at the next pose, so the entrance doctrine applies leg by leg. Three deltas from the element-level recipe:

- **Envelope follows the leg's ease.** An `out` leg (dive, final push) uses the base recipe unchanged. An `inOut` repositioning leg peaks mid-leg: split the envelope at the velocity peak — `0 → PEAK` on the in-half ease over the first half, `PEAK → 0` on the out-half over the second. Seed the proxy at **0** for these (the streaked state lives mid-leg, not at t=0; seed-at-`PEAK_BLUR` belongs to the entrance shape, where the first frame IS the fastest).
- **Filter placement.** 2D camera: `filter: url(#streak)` on the `.world` wrapper. 3D flight: on the **perspective stage** above the 3D context — a `filter` on a `preserve-3d` element flattens it and collapses every `translateZ`. Never per-element inside the world: one frame-wide envelope, not N desynced ones.
- **Full-frame blur is heavy** — cap `PEAK_BLUR` ~18–20 at wrapper level (vs 30 for one element); a brief whip may touch ~24. Axis rule as usual: `"X 0"` for a lateral whip/pan, `"B B"` for a dive/push.

### Whip sweep (named composition)

The heavily-blurred lateral whip that resolves into the next region — two rules on one window:

1. **Position** — [nudge-curve.md](nudge-curve.md)'s three-phase chain on the camera state, tuned burst-dominant (tail still ≥3× ramp-in in time).
2. **Blur** — `0 → PEAK` across the ramp-in, held at `PEAK` through the linear burst (constant velocity = constant smear), `PEAK → 0` across the tail.

Swap or reveal the next region's content DURING the burst — the smear masks the change; the `power4.out` tail lands it sharp. Reveal during the burst, read after the tail.

```js
tl.to(cam, { x: WHIP_X * 0.1, duration: 0.12, ease: "power3.in", onUpdate: applyCamera }, WHIP_AT);
tl.to(
  cam,
  { x: WHIP_X * 0.75, duration: 0.1, ease: "none", onUpdate: applyCamera },
  WHIP_AT + 0.12,
);
tl.to(
  cam,
  { x: WHIP_X, duration: 0.35, ease: "power4.out", onUpdate: applyCamera },
  WHIP_AT + 0.22,
);

tl.to(blurProxy, { v: PEAK_BLUR, duration: 0.12, ease: "power3.in", onUpdate: writeBlur }, WHIP_AT);
// blur holds at PEAK through the linear burst (no tween needed — value rests at PEAK)
tl.to(blurProxy, { v: 0, duration: 0.35, ease: "power4.out", onUpdate: writeBlur }, WHIP_AT + 0.22);
```

## Per-Frame-Driven Carve-In (baked tracks)

When the element is not tweened but **driven** — a tracked insert or callout riding a baked per-frame track, a title matched to camera shake — there is no move window to share. The envelope becomes a per-frame function of the track's own delta, computed in the same `onUpdate` that applies the position.

One element per transform, so no write clobbers another:

```html
<!-- .track: position + any fade, the only element either touches -->
<div class="track">
  <!-- ×2, the lead's box -->
  <div class="streak-ghost" aria-hidden="true" data-layout-allow-overlap></div>
  <!-- Path A only: rotate onto the travel axis; same box as .lead so both rotate about one center -->
  <div class="blur-wrap" style="filter: url(#streak)">
    <!-- counter-rotate only; no GSAP transform tweens on it -->
    <div class="lead">…</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
// inside the frame-lookup driver (an ease:"none" proxy → frames[i]); TRACK.x / TRACK.y are baked arrays
const j = Math.max(1, i); // frame 0 borrows the frame-1 delta so a seek to t=0 has a defined state
const dx = TRACK.x[j] - TRACK.x[j - 1];
const dy = TRACK.y[j] - TRACK.y[j - 1];
const speed = Math.hypot(dx, dy); // px per frame
const angle = (Math.atan2(dy, dx) * 180) / Math.PI; // the streak axis IS the travel direction
track.style.transform = `translate(${TRACK.x[i]}px, ${TRACK.y[i]}px)`;

// Path B, driven form (the default here): text-free silhouette clones trail the lead along −delta.
const base = speed > TRAIL_GATE ? Math.min(TRAIL_MAX, TRAIL_K * speed) : 0;
ghost1.style.transform = `translate(${-dx * 0.25}px, ${-dy * 0.25}px)`;
ghost2.style.transform = `translate(${-dx * 0.5}px, ${-dy * 0.5}px)`;
ghost1.style.opacity = String(base); // a fade on .track multiplies in; never read another tween's value
ghost2.style.opacity = String(base * 0.5);

// Path A, driven form: rotate a filter wrapper onto the travel axis, blur along X only, counter-rotate the content.
const sigma = speed > TRAIL_GATE ? Math.min(SIGMA_MAX, 0.5 * speed) : 0;
blurWrap.style.transform = `rotate(${angle}deg)`;
lead.style.transform = `rotate(${-angle}deg)`;
blurNode.setAttribute("stdDeviation", `${sigma} 0`);
```

Three deltas from the tweened recipe:

- **Ghosts are text-free silhouettes** — the lead's box, border, radius and fill with **no content** (`aria-hidden="true"`, `data-layout-allow-overlap`). A 25–50%-opacity clone reads as shape; a clone carrying the text reads as a duplicate element, and content-free clones give the layout and contrast checkers nothing to flag.
- **Velocity-gated, not window-shaped** — the trail exists only above `TRAIL_GATE` px/frame and scales with speed (`min(TRAIL_MAX, TRAIL_K × speed)`): a slow drift shows nothing, a whip shows a 180°-shutter smear. Fade `.track`, never `.lead`: group opacity takes the trail with it, and the ghost opacity stays a pure function of the frame index whatever order frames are seeked in.
- **Axis from the baked delta** — `atan2(dy, dx)` per frame; the streak follows the track around corners with nothing to seed at setup.

**Which path for a driven subtree.** Path B is the default: it costs no filter raster (a full filter region re-rasterizes every frame under per-frame drive), its clones carry no text so the layout and contrast checkers see nothing new, and it degrades to nothing when the track is still. Path A in the driven form is legitimate when a true blur is the look. Both forms measured deterministic on the reference host (2026-09-08: single-card 120-frame and three-card 450-frame drives of each path, hardware-GL and software lanes, every double render bit-identical) — but a per-frame-driven filter is the first thing to re-measure on a new host: keep the double-render frame-hash comparison (`--format png-sequence` twice) in the pipeline rather than trusting one clean run. One earlier build (2026-08) observed 1-LSB `feGaussianBlur` jitter under per-frame load and shipped Path B for that reason.

## Critical Constraints

- Blur peaks at peak speed and resolves to 0 at the settle — share the ease and window between position and envelope. A blur that lingers after the stop reads as a focus pull.
- Entrances / mid-shot arrivals only — never a mid-composition exit; wrapper-level use only per the Camera-Travel Carve-Out, per-frame-driven use only per the Per-Frame-Driven Carve-In.
- Seed `stdDeviation` at setup: at `PEAK_BLUR` for the entrance shape, at 0 for a whip / `inOut` leg.
- Generous filter region (`x="-50%" y="-50%" width="200%" height="200%"`) or the smear clips at the element's box edge.
- Directional axis: `"X 0"` horizontal, `"0 Y"` vertical, `"B B"` only for a depth/scale move — symmetric blur on a sideways move looks like defocus.
- Dwell ≥1 s sharp after the snap; a streak landing at the last beat reads as "flashed and gone".
- Heavy element on a solid field — thin type (< ~120px / 800 weight) or a busy backdrop swallows the smear.
- `overflow: hidden` on the scene — the smear / furthest ghost extends past the resting position during travel.
- Driven form: clones are text-free silhouettes (`aria-hidden`, `data-layout-allow-overlap`) inside the faded `.track`, axis from the baked delta; nothing is seeded at setup except the structural frame-0 state.

# Waterfall Entry

Staggered ARRIVAL cascade: words/elements whip in from below (one consistent direction),
each starting before the previous settles — an accelerating wave that resolves into a
composed layout. Title cards, segment openers, list/feature intros.

**This is an in-scene arrival, not a seam.** Its seam sibling is the waterfall CUT
(`cut-the-curve` doctrine skill, `seams/waterfall-cut.md`); do not mix their rules:

|               | Entry (this rule — arrival)                   | Waterfall Cut (seam)                                      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Opacity       | BINARY 0→1 via `tl.set` at entry — never fade | ignites at 0.35 mid-path — the fade IS the velocity trick |
| Axis default  | Y, from below                                 | X, riding the current                                     |
| Outgoing side | none                                          | words ramp out on mirrored power4.in                      |

## Choreography

- **Overlap, don't queue** — next element starts within ±2 frames of the previous
  settling; gaps SHRINK across the cascade; the last element snaps.
- **Velocity varies by weight** — heavy/anchor elements travel further and longer;
  light words/punctuation snap in tight:

| Parameter | Anchor/heavy | Normal word | Light/punctuation |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Y offset  | 60–80px      | 40–50px     | 30–48px           |
| Duration  | 0.16–0.20s   | 0.13–0.16s  | 0.10–0.13s        |
| Overlap   | 0–2f gap     | 1f overlap  | 1–2f overlap      |

- Ease `power4.out` (`expo.out` for extra snap); never `.inOut` on an entry.
- One direction per cascade.
- Split the FINAL word into fragments to extend the climax; fragments travel further.
- Post-settle, the group usually slides to make room for the next beat — that's
  [nudge-curve.md](nudge-curve.md).

## JS

Each element: `tl.set` (instant reveal + offset) then `tl.to` (whip to rest).
`nextStart = prevStart + prevDuration − (overlapFrames × F)`; +overlap = cascade,
−overlap = deliberate gap. CSS: elements start `opacity: 0; display: inline-block`.

```js
var F = 1 / 60;
var t0 = 0.1;
// anchor (heaviest): biggest travel, longest settle
tl.set("#el-1", { opacity: 1, y: 80 }, t0);
tl.to("#el-1", { y: 0, duration: 0.18, ease: "power4.out" }, t0);
// normal word: 2 frames after the anchor finishes
var t1 = t0 + 0.18 + 2 * F;
tl.set("#el-2", { opacity: 1, y: 45 }, t1);
tl.to("#el-2", { y: 0, duration: 0.15, ease: "power4.out" }, t1);
// light word: 1 frame BEFORE the previous finishes (overlap)
var t2 = t1 + 0.15 - F;
tl.set("#el-3", { opacity: 1, y: 40 }, t2);
tl.to("#el-3", { y: 0, duration: 0.14, ease: "power4.out" }, t2);
// split final-word fragments: tightest overlap, extra travel (lighter)
var t3 = t2 + 0.14 - F;
tl.set("#frag-a", { opacity: 1, y: 70 }, t3);
tl.to("#frag-a", { y: 0, duration: 0.16, ease: "power4.out" }, t3);
var t4 = t3 + 0.14 - F;
tl.set("#frag-b", { opacity: 1, y: 70 }, t4);
tl.to("#frag-b", { y: 0, duration: 0.15, ease: "power4.out" }, t4);
// punctuation: lightest, fastest
var t5 = t4 + 0.13 - 2 * F;
tl.set("#dot", { opacity: 1, y: 48 }, t5);
tl.to("#dot", { y: 0, duration: 0.12, ease: "power4.out" }, t5);
```

| Same offset/duration for every cascade element         | Vary by weight: anchors travel further, punctuation snaps                         |
| Gradual opacity fade on an arrival                     | Binary 0→1 via `tl.set` — fading fights the snap (seam cuts fade; arrivals don't) |
